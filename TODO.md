ByteMail TODO List
====

Short Term
----------

* Log sent messages
* Address lookup from Address Book
* Date and time of sent message

Long Term
---------

* GUI (although ByteMail is mainly supposed to be command-line based, it is always nice to have a GUI for ease of use)
* Create a Wiki
* Better message database management

If you have any suggestions as to how we can make ByteMail great send me a message, my address is: a01ab3df05f64bf4ba0b18044162d7f0
